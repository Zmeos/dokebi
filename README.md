# Dokebi
Simple workspace time tracking

A simple commandline tool for logging time spend in different workspaces on a linux system. Based on the PEP3143 "Standard daemon process library" of python.

After adding dokebi to your path.
Start the daemon:
```
dokebi start
```
Show a table of your workspaces and the time you spend in them:
```
dokebi show
```
Stop the daemon:
```
dokebi stop
```

Dokebis is little mischievous monsters living in Korean forests. They can be nice, or they can try to trick you. If this one isn't behaving please let me know.
