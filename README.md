# Dokebi
Simple workspace time tracking

A simple commandline tool for logging time spend in different workspaces on a linux system. Based on the PEP3143 "Standard daemon process library" of python. The runner.py file is taken from this library and modified.

After adding dokebi to your path you can simply call:
```
dokebi start
```
To start the daemon

```
dokebi show
```
Will show a table of your workspaces and the time you spend in them

```
dokebi stop
```
Will stop the daemon

Dokebis is little mischievous monsters living in Korean forests. They can be nice, or they can try to trick you. If this one isn't behaving please let me know.
